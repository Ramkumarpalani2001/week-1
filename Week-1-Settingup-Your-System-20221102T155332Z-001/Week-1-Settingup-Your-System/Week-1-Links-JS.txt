Resources
----------
As a developer, you will often need to refer to additional resources in order to learn more about the coding language and to troubleshoot. MDN  (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)is a reliable place to learn more about the specific features of the language. Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/javascript) is a useful community where you can ask questions and respond to others' questions.
